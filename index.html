                    <p class="fade-text">The presidential race appears to be hurtling toward a photo finish, with the final set of polls by The New York Times and Siena College finding Vice President Kamala Harris showing new strength in North Carolina and Georgia as former President Donald J. Trump erases her lead in Pennsylvania and maintains his advantage in Arizona.</p>
                    <div class="spacer-40"></div>
                    <p class="fade-text">It has been decades since the polls have shown the nation facing a presidential race that is so close across so many states in both the Sun Belt and the Rust Belt. The tightly contested landscape means the race remains highly uncertain as the campaign enters its final hours.</p>
                    <div class="spacer-40"></div>
                    <p class="fade-text">Ms. Harris is now narrowly ahead in Nevada, North Carolina and Wisconsin, the polls show, while Mr. Trump leads in Arizona. The polls show them locked in close races in Michigan, Georgia and Pennsylvania. But the results in all seven states are within the margin of sampling error, meaning neither candidate has a definitive lead in any of them.</p>

                    <p class="fade-text">Both candidates have multiple pathways available to capture the 270 Electoral College votes required to claim victory, assuming that polls are not dramatically underestimating the support for one or the other. In such a close race, even a small systemic polling error could tip the contest decisively in either direction.</p>
                    <div class="spacer-40"></div>
                    <p class="fade-text">But there are signs that late deciders are breaking for Ms. Harris: Among the 8 percent of voters who said they had only recently decided on their vote, she wins the group by 55 percent to 44 percent. (With Election Day nearing, 11 percent of voters remained undecided or persuadable, down from 16 percent about a month ago.)</p>

The race is now tied, indicating an increasingly competitive contest in the state, which strategists in both campaigns believe could tip the election.</p>

                    <p class="fade-text">William Renfro, an electrical utility student from Las Vegas working as a part-time barista, said he considered himself a libertarian. “Fiscally, I’m more conservative,” he said. “Socially, I’m more liberal.”</p>
                    <div class="spacer-40"></div>
                    <p class="fade-text">He said that he had decided to support Ms. Harris because he was troubled by the way Mr. Trump had pushed falsehoods about Haitian migrants in Ohio eating dogs and cats, made inflammatory statements, and appeared with Laura Loomer, a far-right activist. “But when you have, you know, with that Laura Loomer thing, and then stuff about the Haitian migrants in Ohio,” he said, “it’s very ‘Why do I want this person to lead the country that I live in?’”</p>
                    <div class="spacer-40"></div>
                    <p class="fade-text">Rates of early voting are particularly high in North Carolina, where more than half the voters said they had already cast a ballot. Ms. Harris wins early voters in the state by 8 percentage points, perhaps contributing to her three-percentage-point edge in the survey of the state. Despite recent devastation there from Hurricane Helene, more than nine out of 10 North Carolina voters said that the storm and its aftermath have had no impact at all on their ability to vote.</p>

                    <p class="fade-text">The only state where the poll found Mr. Trump winning with people who said they had already voted was Arizona. Forty-six percent of voters there said they had already voted, and Mr. Trump wins that group, 50 percent to 46 percent.</p>
                    <div class="spacer-40"></div>
                    <p class="fade-text">The polls also reveal a shift in the issues being prioritized by voters in the final stretch of the race. The economy still remains their top concern, but in states like Wisconsin, where Ms. Harris has held a consistent edge, abortion now nearly matches the economy as voters’ most important issue. And in Arizona, where Mr. Trump leads, immigration also continues to rise as a crucial issue driving voters’ choices.</p>

                    <p class="fade-text">Dakota Parrish, 31, who works at an insurance company, said he was supporting Mr. Trump because he believes the country was more economically prosperous when he was president.</p>
                    <div class="spacer-40"></div>
                    <p class="fade-text">“It’s not so much about, like, Donald Trump as a person in this case,” said Mr. Parrish, who lives in Surprise, Ariz. “People could afford more, could live a happier life under the policies that were put in place.”</p>
                    <div class="spacer-40"></div>
                    <p class="fade-text">The survey shows that Mr. Trump has continued to hold on to the core of the coalition that supported him in his past two presidential bids — white voters who did not attend college, and men — while expanding his support among younger, nonwhite and newer voters. He is exceeding his 2020 vote share in Arizona and Michigan, both states he did not win four years ago.</p>
                    <div class="spacer-40"></div>
                    <p class="fade-text">Ms. Harris is underperforming relative to President Biden’s performance in 2020 with younger voters, Black voters, particularly Black women, and Latino voters. But she has improved on his numbers with these groups since he dropped out of the race in July.</p>
                    <div class="spacer-40"></div>
                    <p class="fade-text">The gender gap remains wide across all seven states, with Ms. Harris the favorite of women and Mr. Trump preferred by men. For women and younger voters, abortion now surpasses the economy as the most important issue driving votes.</p>

                    <p class="fade-text">In Arizona and Nevada, a majority of both men and women also back amendments to codify abortion rights into their state constitutions.</p>
                    <div class="spacer-40"></div>
                    <p class="fade-text">Such a measure has notably more support in Nevada, where 64 percent of voters say they back an amendment to their state constitution. In Arizona, 55 percent of voters support a similar amendment.</p>

                    <p class="fade-text">Voters have sided with abortion rights in all seven states where the question has appeared on the ballot since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the decision that had established a constitutional right to an abortion.</p>
                    <div class="spacer-40"></div>
                    <p class="fade-text">While voters have backed abortion rights in more conservative states, including Kansas and Kentucky, support for the measures has never exceeded 60 percent in any of those states.</p>

                    <h1>How These Polls Were Conducted</h1>
                    <div class="spacer-16"></div>
                    <p class="fade-text">Here are the key things to know about these polls from The New York Times and Siena College:</p>
                    <div class="spacer-40"></div>
                </div>
            </section>
            <section class="lazy-section">
                <div class="margin-20">
                    <ul class="bullet-points">
                        <li class="bullet-points fade-text">Interviewers spoke with 7,879 likely voters across the seven battleground states, including 1,025 voters in Arizona, 1,004 voters in Georgia, 998 voters in Michigan, 1,010 voters in Nevada, 1,010 voters in North Carolina, 1,527 voters in Pennsylvania and 1,305 voters in Wisconsin from Oct. 24 to Nov. 2.</li>
                        <li class="bullet-points fade-text" >Times/Siena polls are conducted by telephone, using live interviewers, in both English and Spanish. Overall, more than 98 percent of respondents were contacted on a cellphone for these polls. You can see the exact questions that were asked and the order in which they were asked here.</li>
                        <li class="bullet-points fade-text" >Voters are selected for the survey from a list of registered voters. The list contains information on the demographic characteristics of every registered voter, allowing us to make sure we reach the right number of voters of each party, race and region. For these polls, interviewers placed about 850,000 calls to more than 320,000 voters.</li>
                        <li class="bullet-points fade-text" >To further ensure that the results reflect the entire voting population, not just those willing to take a poll, we give more weight to respondents from demographic groups that are underrepresented among survey respondents, like people without a college degree. You can see more information about the characteristics of respondents and the weighted sample at the bottom of the results and methodology page, under “Composition of the Sample.”</li>
                        <li class="bullet-points fade-text" >The margin of sampling error among likely voters is plus or minus 1.3 percentage points across the seven battleground states and about plus or minus 3.5 percentage points in each state poll. In theory, this means that the results should reflect the views of the overall population most of the time, though many other challenges create additional sources of error. When the difference between two values is computed — such as a candidate’s lead in a race — the margin of error is twice as large.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p class="fade-text">The Times/Siena polls of Pennsylvania in 2024 were conducted in partnership with the Philadelphia Inquirer and were funded in part by a grant from the Lenfest Institute for Journalism. The poll was designed and conducted independently from the institute.</p>
